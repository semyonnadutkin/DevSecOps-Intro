# Lab 1 — Submission

## Triage Report: OWASP Juice Shop

### Scope & Asset
- Asset: OWASP Juice Shop (local lab instance)
- Image: `bkimminich/juice-shop:v20.0.0`
- Image digest: sha256:fd58bdc9745416afce8184ee0666278a436574633ea7880365153a63bfd418b0
- Host OS: Arch Linux
- Docker version: 29.5.2

### Deployment Details
- Run command used: `docker run -d --name juice-shop -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop:v20.0.0`
- Access URL: http://127.0.0.1:3000
- Network exposure: 127.0.0.1 only? [x] Yes [ ] No (explain if No)
- Container restart policy: `no` _(`--restart` flag was not used)_

### Health Check
- HTTP code on `/`: 200
- API check (first 200 chars of `/rest/products`):
  ```json
  {"status":"success","data":[{"id":1,"name":"Apple Juice (1000ml)","description":"The all-time classic.","price":1.99,"deluxePrice":0.99,"image":"apple_juice.jpg","createdAt":"2026-06-07T12:38:42.261Z"
  ```
- Container uptime: _"Up About an hour"_  
  Exact output:
  ```bash
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS             PORTS                      NAMES
  f647ccef46a1   bkimminich/juice-shop:v20.0.0   "/nodejs/bin/node /j…"   15 hours ago   Up About an hour   127.0.0.1:3000->3000/tcp   juice-shop
  ```

### Initial Surface Snapshot (from browser exploration)
- Login/Registration visible: [x] Yes [ ] No — notes: `Account` button in the top-right corner _(serves the login form on click)_. `Not yet a customer?` button serves the signup form.
- Product listing/search present: [x] Yes [ ] No — notes: when requesting `/`, the user is redirected to `/#/` where the products are listed. Clicking the search icon in the top-right corner and performing a search redirects to `/#/search?q=<query>`.
- Admin or account area discoverable: [x] Yes [ ] No — notes: account area is discoverable from the browser _(e.g. `/#/wallet` and `/#/order-history` routes)_. Admin area is not discoverable from browser.
- Client-side errors in DevTools console: [x] Yes [ ] No — notes: when accessing `/#/wallet` being unauthorized, `401 Unauthorized` is thrown.
- Pre-populated local storage / cookies: cookie `language: en` is set on the first visit.

### Security Headers (Quick Look)
Run: `curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3000 2>&1 | head -20`. Paste output:

Which of these are MISSING? (cross-reference Lecture 1 OWASP Top 10:2025 — A06)
- [x] `Content-Security-Policy`
- [x] `Strict-Transport-Security`
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options`

### Top 3 Risks Observed (2-3 sentences each, in your own words)
1. **A07:2025 Identification & Authentication Failures** — to signup, a user must set a security question to regain control in case they forget the password. A security question is considered an anti-pattern since it is easily guessable and can be found in public sources.
2. **A05:2025 Security Misconfiguration** — `Content-Security-Policy` and `Strict-Transport-Security` headers are missing. Missing security headers reduce browser-side protections and may increase the impact of client-side attacks and insecure transport configurations.
3. **A01:2025 Broken Access Control** — the `/rest/basket/<ID>` endpoint does not validate if the user owns the basket `<ID>`. An attacker can access other users' baskets with `curl`: `curl -iX GET http://127.0.0.1:3000/rest/basket/<ID> -H "Authorization: Bearer <attackers JWT>`.
